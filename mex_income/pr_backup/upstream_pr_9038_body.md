<!-- https://github.com/beyond-all-reason/Beyond-All-Reason/pull/9038 — module: tech core — body as of 2026-09-29 -->

## Context
The Tech Core sharing mode, built as tech's plug-in into transfer. Unit sharing and resource tax scale with tier (constructors become shareable at T2, tax eases as you climb), and `/take` runs on a 60 second delay for Resource buildings.

## What's It Do
Transfer declares the slots and this PR fills them:

- An enrichment that provides blocking terms, effective sharing modes and the tax rate into the pairing context.
- A per-team tax provision for the paths that have no pairing, like waterfill.
- The tooltip notes (future unlocks, keystone counts, the next tax rate) that transfer's comms display without knowing where they came from.

The preset and its spec live here. Transfer builds and passes without this PR, which is the dependency direction the module graph now records: `tech` requires `transfer`, never the reverse.
